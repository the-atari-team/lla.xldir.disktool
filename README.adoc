= Atari 8bit disc image tool

Small Java tool, to read Atari 8bit discs images like ATR (contains 16 bytes header), XFD (no header) or LiteDOS images in batch mode.

Why an other new ATR tool, because I would like to program one by myself. Just for knowledge.

=== This tool has:

* [x] read, write sd format support
* [x] read, write dd format support
* [x] read, write ed format support (2. vtoc on sector 1024)
* [x] LiteDOS read(Dos 2.5) and write in main directory, but no subdirectory support.
* [x] read,write with character conversion support in TXT-files
* [x] read,write also with line number support on LST-files see below
* [x] batchable, the most important for me

== Some TODOs
* [ ] lot of german comments, sorry
* [ ] use Atari error numbers!
* [ ] Better check invalid directory entries
* [ ] insert single file without the insert file
* [x] overread REM in LST files
* [ ] at least Umlauts should be interpreted correctly
* [ ] LiteDOS format, small cluster with less entries in directory
* [ ] Umlaut Support
* [ ] UTF-8 Support

== Parameter
Usage::
[source]
  java -jar xldir.jar <Atari disc image> <command> <file> ...
  or as quick starter
  xldir <Atari disc image> <command> <file> ...

When no <command> is given, the fallback takes over : command := list

=== commands
list:: shows directory or given Atari disc image
list all:: shows directory and also deleted files, therefore we check if file is completely readable.
The sectors are tracked internally. If this is ok, the file can be extracted, otherwise the file is marked as defective.

extract file:: extracts a file, lower case letters can also be used, but the result is what the Atari disc contains.


==== extract rules for TXT files
 - is it a TXT file, line ending to Unix is applied
 - is it a LST file, line numbers will be removed and line ending to Unix applied

extract all:: extract all files
 - all rules will be used

insert file::
To write files on to a Atari disc image, you must create an "insert-file".
Due to the fact there exists a lot of restrictions in Atari file system,
max 8 characters for name, 3 characters for extension, only upper case,
we need an insert-file which contains the translation for the name.
This file will read and interpreted. xldir copies all files given in the insert-file to Atari disc image.

- In addition, you can specify in the insert file what should happen to the files:
Possible format in insert file: always in one line:

Comments start with '#'

file.ext::
Copies the file 'file.ext' into the Atari disc image.
The rules for special endings apply.

Long file name.extension \-> SHORT.EXT::
Copies the file with the 'long file name.extension' as SHORT.EXT into the Atari disc image.
The rules for special endings apply.

file name \-> plain \-> SHORT.EXT::
Copies the file 'file name' plain as SHORT.EXT into the Atari disc image and no rules will apply.

file name \-> list \-> SHORT.EXT::
Copies the file 'file name' as SHORT.EXT into the Atari disc image and
apply the rules for LST files.

-

makesd::
makeed::
makedd:: creates new right sized empty discs, must be formatted and initialised by an Atari-DOS with the emulator. Will also not write the default 3x128 bootsectors.

hexdump:: create a hexdump of the given atari disc and store it under the given new name.

fsck:: performs a disc check,
- all files will check on disc by follow there next position header (last 3 bytes) errors will identify.
A repair does not be done.

==== insert rules for TXT-files
- is it a TXT-file, unix/windows line ending will convert to Atari 0x9b return.


==== insert Regeln f√ºr LST Dateien
Ist EXT == LST::
- is it a LST file,
- unix/windows line ending will convert to Atari 0x9b return
- line numbers will be added
- empty lines will overread
- lines start with REM will leave out
- lines containing :REM ... will remove everything from :REM to lineend
- starts a line with '!', everything will written to file without
line number and without the first '!'.
So '!run' at the end will execute the program after file is entered.

=== examples
[source]
--
java -jar xldir.jar disc.atr list
java -jar xldir.jar disc.atr list all
java -jar xldir.jar disc.atr extract turbobas.com
java -jar xldir.jar disc.atr extract all
or
xldir disc.atr
xldir disc.atr list
xldir disc.atr list all

== Installation
After successful build, copy the disktool/target/xldir.jar to
a directory, where a path in your $PATH variable shows to. Then
create the following simple script like
[source]
#!/bin/bash
SCRIPT=$(dirname $0)
java -jar ${SCRIPT}/xldir.jar $@

Rename this script to `xldir` and give
it execute flags like
`chmod +x xldir`. Now on console, call `xldir`
and you will get the usage information of this disc tool.

Here also a script exists. `./deploy.sh` but due to the fact that
every user has a different environment, you shuld not use it.
It is just for me to install this compiler on my Windows (mingw) PC
and on my Linux PC. Maybe you find it useful.


== Sorry
In the source you will find lot of german comments, sorry for that.

You need this tool named `xldir` to build Oxygene Be from source.
